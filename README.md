**Personalized User Experience**
- It is important to provide personalized recommendations based on diseases and other health information entered by the user. The application can recommend pills taking into account the user's health status, medical history, and preferences, and can provide additional information that the user needs.

**Real-time Location-Based Service**
- The ability to locate pill collection boxes should be updated in real time. To do this, it is necessary to identify the nearest pill collection box based on the user's location and provide the user with quick and accurate information.

**Community and user feedback**
- It is important to collect user feedback and continuously improve applications accordingly. By listening to and reflecting users' requirements and opinions, application usability and better service can be provided.
